# Quick Test

Simple unit testing for easily-annoyed people.

## What?

You create state-based unit tests (inputs, transform, outputs) in a little window next to your code.
When you change the code, the tests re-run. When you move on to another function, so does Quick Test.

You don't:

* Create a test project.
* Make up names for tests.

You do:

* Test the code

## Yeah, but

Yeah, but it's better than not writing any unit tests at all.
